# README
This is a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) of the Wordpress theme [Twenty Eleven](https://wordpress.com/theme/twentyeleven). It was originally created for [Nelson's homepage](http://www.skyfaller.space), then modified for [Stairball.club](http://www.stairball.club/). 

## Font
I use @font-face (more specifically, the [Fontspring method](http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax)) to import an open source font from [The League of Moveable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/), specifically [Chunk](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk), to use in the header.

I'd like to [de-Google-ify my sites](https://markosaric.com/degoogleify/), and [self-hosting seems to provide better performance than Google Fonts](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/should-you-self-host-google-fonts/).
