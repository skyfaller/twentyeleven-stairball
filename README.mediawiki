== README ==
This is a [http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes child theme] of the Wordpress theme [http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/twentyeleven/ Twenty Eleven]. It was originally created for [http://skyfaller.net Skyfaller.net], Nelson's personal homepage, then modified for [http://stairball.org/ Stairball.org]. 

=== Font ===
I use @font-face (more specifically, the [http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax Fontspring method]) to import a font from [http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/ The League of Moveable Type], specifically [https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk Chunk], to use in the header.

Maybe I should use Google Web Fonts instead, but I hate relying on Google for everything.
